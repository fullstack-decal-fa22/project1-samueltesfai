                <p>This role saw me on a research team whose goal was to provide valuable insights and suggestions on
                    promoting equity and inclusion for underrepresented students in UC Berkeley's College of Engineering
                    grad program. The team spent the semester analyzing graduate student data and speaking with key
                    faculty members in the College of Engineering to better understand the graduate student experience.
                    At the end of the semester, my team gave a presentation, which included data visualizations the team
                    created, to the dean and other notable faculty members that summarized our key findings and policy
                    suggestions.</p>

                <p>GeniusMesh is a networking platform for job seekers and employers who graduated from an EMBA program.
                    I worked alongside a team to complete tasks that improved their site. My biggest contribution during
                    the internship was addressing the bugs and improving the code for the company's faceted search
                    interface, which allowed employers to search through a catalog of job seekers on the network.</p>
